- project: EPSRC UnMute
  duration: 2020 &mdash; 2024
  url: "https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T024976/1"
  description: UnMute aims to address the limitations of today's speech and voice-based interactions and open up intelligent interfaces to the currently digitally ‘unheard’. In this project, I have developed methods for zero-resource cross-lingual transfer of ASR models and methods for spoken information retrieval in unwritten languages.

- project: EPSRC COG-MHEAR
  duration: 2021 &mdash; 2025
  url: "https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T021063/1"
  description: The goal of COG-MHEAR is to develop cognitively-inspired 5G-IoT enabled, multi-modal hearing aids. In this project, I helped co-organise the Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement challenge and I worked on devising new protocols for evaluation of speech enhancements models.

- project: IARPA Material
  duration: 2016 &mdash; 2021
  url: "https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/material"
  description: The goal of Material was to develop a tool that would allow analysts to consume foreign text and speech media regardless of their language expertise. I worked on semi-supervised training of ASR models that allowed us to train models with small amounts of manually transcribed data and large amounts of crawled text and speech.

- project: H2020 SUMMA
  duration: 2016 &mdash; 2019
  url: "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/688139"
  description: The goal of SUMMA was to develop a platform to automate the analysis of media streams across many languages. In this project, I developed methods for automatic punctuation prediction in ASR transcripts and I was responsible deployment of ASR and punctuation models.

- project: CloudASR
  duration: 2014 &mdash; 2015
  url: "https://github.com/UFAL-DSG/cloud-asr"
  description: CloudASR is a cloud based automatic speech recognition platform which supports both batch and online speech recognition. The key features are scalability, customizability and easy deployment. It is tested to be able to handle more than 1000 parallel requests given enough computational resources.

- project: MT-ComparEval
  duration: 2011 &mdash; 2013
  url: "https://github.com/choko/MT-ComparEval"
  description: MT–ComparEval is a tool for comparison and evaluation of machine translation. Translations can be compared according to automatic metrics for whole documents or single sentences. Differences between translations can be visualized by highlighting matching/missing n-grams etc.
